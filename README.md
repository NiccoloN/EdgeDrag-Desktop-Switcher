# A KWin script for Plasma 6
Automatic desktops switch by dragging files across screen edges.

When you’re dragging a window or file, surpassing a configured screen edge moves to the next virtual desktop in that direction.

Includes a quick “switch on edge” toggle for apps whose drags aren’t detectable.

Drag detection only implemented for x11.
